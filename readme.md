## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My Process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML markup
- CSS selectors
- Flexbox

### What I learned

In this project I challenge myself to recap the basics of the web development: **`HTML5`** and **`CSS3`**.

To make the page basis, I've used semantic **HTML5** markup, to improve the readability. To the appearance, the common CSS was used allied with BEM CSS pattern of nomenclature and CSS selectors. In short:

- HTML5
  - Semantic markup
- CSS3
  - BEM CSS pattern
  - CSS selectors
  - Flexbox
